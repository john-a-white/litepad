# Source
Please pick the appropriate source for your architecture. These contain versions of QtFindReplaceDialog specially compiled for them.

If you use the amd64 source on an i386, it may fail to compile!

If you are running a different architecture, you will need to recompile QtFindReplaceDialog. See http://qtfindreplace.sourceforge.net/html/index.html for more information on how to do that.
